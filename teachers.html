<h2>Meet our Teachers</h2>

<p>At <strong>Puddle Jumpers Workshop</strong>, while the practical care of our
kids is done by working parents, the tone of the day is always set by our
Activity Coordinators (or, informally, our teachers).  The ACs develop
activities according to the developmental makeup of the children attending each
day, recent subjects of interest -- even the seasons.  Generally there will be
one AC and two working parents present at any given time - the teachers lead
the flow of the day, while children come and go from play and activities as
their interests lead them.</p>

<h3>Teacher Claire</h3>

Claire Brekhus has been teaching for Puddle Jumpers since April 2011; her
passion for children has always been a big part of her life since she began
babysitting at age 12.  At 17 she started working as a technician in UCSF's
Department of Pediatrics, thus realizing she wanted to work directly with
children again.  Returning to school to study child development at City College
of San Francisco, Claire worked for three years at Marin Day Schools' Bright
Horizons preschools before joining full-time at Puddle Jumpers.
</p>

<p>Claire's goal as a teacher in the co-op is to provide a safe, healthy, fun,
and inviting environment in which every child in her care is able to make new
accomplishments.  She seeks to enable each child to experience new things
through play, to build healthy relationships, and feel proud of who they are. 
</p>

<p>While PJW doesn't strictly adhere to a particular teaching philosophy,
Claire employs a combination of Reggio Emilia and play-based practices.  On a
typical day there are most always two arranged activities available at any
given time with a crafting, tactile, fine- or gross-motor focus.  Children opt
into these activities as they prefer, or are free to make use of our
classroom's abundant options for play, costuming or quiet reading.  Claire also
discovers new options for our twice-daily outings, finding new sights and
experiences around our Mission district neighborhood.
</p>

<p>Claire lives in San Francisco with her 2.5 year old son Christopher; she
enjoys reading, running, and crafts.

<h3>Teacher Michele</h3>

Michele &amp; kids at the craft table" style="float: left; padding: 0em 0.7em 0.7em 0" />

Michele Menard is a interdisciplinary artist  and educator with twenty five
years of education and experience in drama, mask &amp; puppetry, creative
writing, musical performance, visual arts, and directing. She holds a
BFA in drama and poetry from Rhode Island College and an associate
teaching/music degree from City College of SF. Michele has been an
art teacher for many years in programs throughout the Bay Area.
Besides working as an Activity Coordinator for PJW, she is a Resident
Artist for the Richmond District Neighborhood Center, teaching puppetry and
drama to elementary students.  She directs the students in end-of-semester
performances.  Her mixed media paintings and book illustrations have been 
showcased locally and internationally.
</p>

<p>Her strengths as an artist have supported her as a Teacher where she is able
to use her love of drama, literacy, puppetry, self-expression and imagination to
support emerging minds. She believes her role is to help facilitate play where
the window of opportunities of learning are opened while following the lead of
the child's interest.
</p>

<p>She often uses literacy-engaging events like story time and finger plays to
encourage a child's budding curiousity at PJW's "circle time" -- often her favorite group-concentration activities.  She also loves outdoor play where
she will often be found eating imaginary ice cream cones or feeding the pretend
animals from the zoo.  Michele has found that dramatic play is a essential
component of healthy brain development and pure fun. The wonderment of life is
still very much alive for her and that is what connect her so well with the
children she works with along with her patience and sense of humor.
