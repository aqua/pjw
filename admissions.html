<h2>Admissions</h2>

<p><strong>Puddle Jumpers Workshop</strong> offers rolling admissions
year-round, drawing from our waiting pool as needed with an eye to maintaining
age, gender and other balances.  Most years, we experience our biggest drop in
membership in late summer and early fall as kids matriculate to preschool.
Please plan accordingly if you wish to start the application process.</p>

<p>Prospective applicants must complete at least two visits (one morning and
one afternoon).  Visiting children should be at least 16 months old and thus
capable of interacting with other toddlers.</p>

<p>After visiting, you may submit an application, along with a $35 processing
fee. Your application will be reviewed at the next scheduled member meeting. If
we are full at the time of your acceptance, you will be notified and placed in
our waiting pool.
</p>

<p>To schedule a visit, please contact our New Member Coordinator at <a
href="mailto:info@puddlejumpersworkshop.com">info@puddlejumpersworkshop.com</a>.</p>
		
<h3>Making the Most of Your Visit</h3>

<p>We are looking forward to meeting you!  These visits are your chance to get
to know Puddle Jumpers Workshop, meet our other members and determine if the
school is a good fit for your family.  Visiting children are welcome to join in
all activities; parents are encouraged to jump in and act as childcare
providers.
</p>

<p>Morning visits run from 9:00am to 12:30pm, when the kids finish lunch and
start going down for naps. Afternoon visits run from 3:00-5:00pm.  Directions
and details will be provided by the New Members Coordinator prior to your
visit.
